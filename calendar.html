				<h2>Special Circumstances</h2>
				<p>Any accommodations you need regarding the schedule need to be set up by Wednesday of week 2. After that time, no exceptions will be made except for emergency situations at the instructor's discretion.</p>
				<h2>Final Exam</h2>
				<h3>Scheduling</h3>
				<p>You <strong>must schedule a time to take the final exam, with a proctor, at least 2 weeks before the exam.</strong> If you do not do this you risk not being able to take the final and losing a very significant portion of your grade.</p>
				<p>The exam window runs from 12:00am Pacific Time on the Sunday beginning exam week through 11:59pm Wednesday of exam week. The exam must be started and finished within that window.</p>
				<h3>ProctorU</h3>
				<p>I highly recommend you do not use ProctorU. Students have had their exams canceled due to ProctorU maintenance. They are not reliable enough to use as a proctor. <strong>If you choose to use them, you do so at your own risk. If anything goes wrong, you have no recourse regardless of fault.</strong> If their server blows up on the day you need to take the exam, I will simply say I told you so. If your internet dies because a landslide took out a telephone pole you will not get credit for the final and will not get an extension to take it later. I strongly suggest you take it at a proctoring center. They typically have redundant systems and should an issue arise you will be granted reasonable accommodations.<p>
